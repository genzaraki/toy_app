#  Project: Toy App

In this project we develop a toy demo application to show off some of the power of Rails. The purpose is to get a high-level overview of Ruby on Rails programming (and web development in general) by rapidly generating an application using scaffold generators, which create a large amount of functionality automatically. [Based on the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/getting-your-feet-wet)
